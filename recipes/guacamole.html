    </p>
    <h3>How to keep Guacamole from turning brown?</h3>
    <p>
        Avocados have a tendency to turn brown when they're exposed to air, so guacamole loses its brightness rather quickly. You can prevent this by placing the guacamole in an airtight container, then covering the top with a thin layer of water, lemon juice, or lime juice. This barrier will keep the air from getting in. Seal the container and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days. 
    </p>
    <h3>Can you freeze Guacamole?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, you can freeze guacamole. Ladle it (in serving-size portions) into freezer bags, squeeze out the excess air, and flatten. Wrap the bags in foil for extra protection against freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator.
